"""Build an Nth Fibonacci Number Calculator
Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should create a function named fibonacci.
You should define a list named sequence within the fibonacci function, and it should be initialized with the values [0, 1].
The fibonacci function should accept one parameter, a positive integer n.
Calling fibonacci(n) should use a dynamic programming approach to compute and return the n-th number from the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
Each computed number at the position n in the Fibonacci sequence should be stored in the sequence list at index n - 1.
